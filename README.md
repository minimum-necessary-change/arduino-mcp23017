This library provides full control over the Microchip's [MCP23017](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCP23017), including interrupt support.

## Features
 * Individual pins read & write
 * Ports read & write
 * Registers read & write
 * Full interrupt support

## Usage
Unlike most Arduino library, no default instance is created when the library is included. It's up to you to create one with the appropriate chip I2C address.

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <MCP23017.h>

MCP23017 mcp = MCP23017(0x24);
```

Additionaly, you can specify the `Wire` instance to use as a second argument. For instance `MCP23017(0x24, Wire1)`.  
See included examples for furher usage.
